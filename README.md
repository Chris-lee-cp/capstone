## Project: Stock Prediction Machine Learning

**Note**

Install

This project requires Python 2.7(if you complete this project in Python 3.x, you will have to update the code in various places including all relevant print statements) and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook


If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.


Code
4 python codes and one ipython notebook file. 
sp_ml.py - base class
sp_linear_reg.py - define linear regression algorithm/pre-processing/predict methods in this class
sp_polinomial_reg.py - define polynomial regression algorithm/pre-processing/predict methods in this class 
sp_knn_reg.py - define knn regression algorithm/pre-processing/predict methods in this class
sp_main.ipynb - ipython notebook file. this create each algorithm instances and learn/predict/display


Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory capstone/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook sp_main.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook sp_main.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Data
Data files for this project were attained from yahoo finance web site. pandas_datareader get_data_yahoo method was used.
